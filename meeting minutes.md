## Meeting Minutes 17.06.22

V&A still reviewing request for data, has not updated on when we can expect this. 

In the meantime, we are looking to consider the following: 
1) How best to label the data once it arrives, to reflect the V&A data and to better serve the project's wider mission
2) Options to gamify, such as encouraging users to guess which images from the dataset may have informed the generated image - this would have the larger goal of driving engagement with the V&A collection / website 
3) Outputs beyond the model i.e. written reports / how we want to present the model in terms of wider context, aims, implications. 
4) Further research avenues for when this project is finished? 

Daphne suggested including some images from the training dataset that have a high similarity with the generated image. This could give some insight into how the generator works while also drawing attention back to real objects in the collection.

Need to think more about how to build and host the interface - what level of complexity are we aiming for? What is feasible in the given time frame? 

In terms of engagement, possibility to talk to major V&A curators specialising in areas that are well represented in our data i.e. ceramics, see how they respond to the generator, what they think may be interesting avenues of further research and what they make of the objects generated. How could this be incorporated into the Digital Design Weekend presentation?
