### TODO ITEMS


Make a better parameters file so that we can control everything for training in there

Make sure it works when use_filename = False

Set up a method to do create input text in a well thought out way

Set up a different file just messing with prompts rather than re-running the model

Collect data to use for transfer learning (compare with original model)

Create a balanced dataset of objects and styles that we might want to be able to combine

Once we have the data:
Can we create input text directly from what is in the dataset or do we need to do some preprocessing / clustering to get more discrete / defined styles?

How to judge a good match - closer or wackier? Possibility to offer multiple outputs offering a range?
